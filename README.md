# E-Kart
E-kart is a full stack E-commerce application built on React.js, Tailwind CSS & Java Springboot

## Features
E-Kart is mainly developed for my hands-on experience on React. It includes React hooks, React-router, navigation etc. Backend is built on Java springboot with spring security using JWT. It is also integrated with a Mysql database with the help of Hibernate.
